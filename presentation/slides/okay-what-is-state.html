<h2>Okay... what is state?</h2>

<p>State is basically a snapshot off your app at any given time (the variables, view, route, etc). So examples of state would be:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The user variable that stores all of the information about the user that is logged in</li>
    <li>The currently selected option in a dropdown</li>
    <li>The current route that the user is on in the app</li>
    <li>The URL that is used to make API calls to the backend</li>
</ul>
