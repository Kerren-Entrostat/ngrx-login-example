<h2>What is NGRX?</h2>

<p>NGRX is a redux like library that creates a "Reactive state" in Angular. In <span style="font-weight: bold;">my opinion</span>

<blockquote>
    NGRX creates a state that can be shared throughout the application and any part of the system can subscribe to changes in this state.
