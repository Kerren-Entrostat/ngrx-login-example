<h2>Redux Summary - Reducers</h2>

<p>A reducer takes an action and makes a change to the state based on that action.</p>

<pre class="fragment fade-up"><code class="typescript">export function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {

    switch (action.type) {

        case '[Login] Login Successful':
            return {
                ...state,
                user: action.payload
            };

        default:
            return state;

    }
    
}
</code></pre>
